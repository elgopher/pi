# Contributing to Pi

:tada: Hi! I'm really glad you're considering contributing to π! :tada:

## Here are a few ways you can contribute

1. **Star the project** ⭐
2. **Just use it and give feedback** - try to write a tiny app/game. Give feedback by starting a [discussion](https://github.com/elgopher/pi/discussions).
3. **Review code and suggest changes** - π is under development. The design is not final and will change in the future. You can influence the design by
starting a [discussion](https://github.com/elgopher/pi/discussions) on Github.
4. **Make an example** - write a short (but fancy) example ;)
5. **Improve Go docs** - add more detailed descriptions of public functions and fields.
