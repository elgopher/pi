// Example showing how to change screen resolution and run Ï€ functions before game loop.
package main

import (

func main() {
	// set screen resolution:
	pi.ScreenWidth = 44
	pi.ScreenHeight = 44

	// boot the game with custom screen resolution:
	pi.MustBoot()

	// once boot is executed all drawing functions are available:
	pi.Print("TINY SCREEN", 0, 18, 7) // print text on the screen before game loop

	// Run the game loop.
	pi.MustRun(ebitengine.Backend)
	// Update and Draw functions were not set therefore screen will not be changed.
